                               it was febaury 2022 when we decided tha we would take a  trip down to london after being left at andover train staion, where we tried to call the guard to get us on the train but completely engored us, so we spoke to the guard on the next train, who offered us 2 free return tickets to anywhere on the SWR network.

                            when it was the day of our trip to london we decided, we would visit the london sealife aquarium, but unfortunately, it was fully booked for the day and were no tickets avalible on the day. Instead we went into the Shrek adventures attraction as my mum wanted to go in last time but never got the chance, luckly they had some tickets left at the time we wanted. 
                            </p>  
                            <p class="blog_post_p">
                            So as we went in, we enter a magical lift which took us up a floor had the chance for a toilet break (inside the toilets they had speakers wwhich said stuff like "ewww you've washed your hands" in shrek's voice) and then got our photo taken while we are  waiting to go in the main attraction, after waiting, we were in this big room where one of the staff at the attraction explained through some legal/ health and saftey proticols, so if anything bad was to happen then we would know what to do.
